### From viral puzzles to product strategy â€” still creating, still learning.  
**15 years and counting creating products.**

I love creating things â€” products, systems, and experiences that bring clarity where thereâ€™s chaos.  
From building *Klueless*, one of Indiaâ€™s first viral online puzzles, to leading and advising teams across design, UX, and product strategy â€” Iâ€™ve always been drawn to the intersection of creativity and systems thinking.
