### From viral puzzles to product strategy â€” still creating, still learning.  
**15 years and counting creating products.**

I love creating things â€” products, systems, and experiences that bring clarity where thereâ€™s chaos.  
From building *Klueless*, one of Indiaâ€™s first viral online puzzles, to leading and advising teams across design, UX, and product strategy â€” Iâ€™ve always been drawn to the intersection of creativity and systems thinking.

I love creating things â€” products, systems, and experiences that bring clarity where thereâ€™s chaos.

Two decades ago, I built Klueless, one of Indiaâ€™s first viral online puzzles. It opened doors for a generation of problem-solvers â€” and taught me the joy of designing for curiosity and flow. Since then, Iâ€™ve led product and UX teams, advised startups, and explored decision-making under uncertainty in ways few PMs ever get to experience firsthand.

My journey hasnâ€™t been linear â€” by design. Each chapter, whether building, consulting, or stepping back to reset, has deepened how I think about people, products, and systems. Today, I help early-stage teams turn ideas into structure and complexity into clarity.

I thrive at the intersection of product, design, and human behavior â€” where great teams make bold, thoughtful things that actually work.
